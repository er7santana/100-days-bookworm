# Bookworm

In this project we’re going to build an app to track which books you’ve read and what you thought of them, and it’s going to follow a similar theme to project 10: let’s take all the skills you’ve already mastered, then add some bonus new skills that take them all to a new level.

This time you’re going to meet SwiftData, which is Apple’s framework for working with databases. This project will serve as an introduction for SwiftData, but we’ll be going into much more detail soon.

At the same time, we’re also going to build our first custom user interface component – a star rating widget where the user can tap to leave a score for each book. This will mean introducing you to another property wrapper, called @Binding – trust me, it will all make sense.

## Features

Today you have four topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about @Binding, TextEditor, SwiftData, and more.

- Creating a custom component with @Binding
- Accepting multi-line text input with TextEditor
- Introduction to SwiftData and SwiftUI
